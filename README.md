My first readme
Inside 0x01-git I Created directories at the root of your project: bash, c, js
I Create these empty files: c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, js/index.js
I Created a file bash/alx with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "ALX"
I Created a file bash/school with these two lines inside: #!/bin/bash and echo "School"

I Created an empty file named bash/98
Updated bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School"
Updated bash/school by replacing echo "School" with echo "The school is open!"
Added and committed these changes (message: “My personal work”)

Changed branch to main and Updated the file bash/alx by replacing echo "ALX" with echo "ALX School is so cool!"
Deleted the directory js
